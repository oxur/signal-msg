*Handle UNIX process signals with a shared channel (uses simple-signal)*

## About

This project aims to make simple signal handling even simpler: just use
messages. Since passing objects into an anonymous function signal handler can
get tricky, `signal-msg` offers an alternative approach of listening for
signals on a receiver.

This library was created for ease of use when setting up examples that needed a
quick and easy setup for signal handling, providing a message-based solution
around the [simple-signal](https://github.com/swizard0/rust-simple-signal)
library. A more robust (if also more verbose) solution is possible when using
the [signal-hook](https://github.com/vorner/signal-hook) library.

Similar functionality to signal-msg is provided by the
[signal-notify](https://crates.io/crates/signal-notify) and
[chan-signal](https://crates.io/crates/chan-signal) libraries (note, though,
that the latter is deprecated).)

## Usage

```rust
use signal_msg::{self, SignalReceiver, SignalSender};

fn main() {
    let (signal_sender, signal_receiver) = signal_msg::new();
    signal_sender.prepare_signals();
    println!("Waiting for a signal...");
    let sig = signal_receiver.listen();
    println!("Got signal: {:?}", sig.unwrap());
}
```
